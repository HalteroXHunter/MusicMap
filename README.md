Music project with Spotify API, Network Analysis and NLP

**Music Connectivity

Many of us consider music as something essential in our lives, it motivates us, inspires creativity and fuels us towards anything we might be doing.
We can all agree that it activates a more human side of us.

In a changing world with emerging ideas and continuous specialization, the music industry isn’t an exception, and casually we are very passionate about music and more specifically the chosen genre, Rap.

Could you imagine a way to relate the rap communities and create a network using Data Science? Well this Project is an approach for this idea.
Putting together everything we have learn in the Bootcamp and our passion for music we decided to create a set of tools that could be useful for the artists in the Rap genre for the spanish community.

**Main Ideas
**Exploration of a certain space 

First of all in order to tackle this approach we decided to look into a specific space within the music industry, in this case spanish Rap Music. For the last years we have seen this specific part of the music industry grow exponentially as a rise of the urban/hip hop music influenced by the US.
One thing that characterizes this genre is the amount of collaborations in their songs and the lyricism used.

- Graph community analysis -
The project is separated in two parts, one of them is community analysis. This consists on the connections between the given Nodes (artists) and the Edges (collaborations) between each nodes which connects them.
Using the library NetworkX we can draw the network and separate it into communities for their further connectivity analysis.

- Lyric analysis classification -
The other part of the Project corresponds to the track lyrics of the chosen artists. Here we analyze the lexical richness of their tracks and using a non-supervised machine learning model called clustering, we are capable of creating different groups (also called ‘clusters’) and thereby be able to classify any new tracks that we include in this model.

- Tool development & conclusions -
Using the previous mentioned approaches we are able to draw a set of tools that the artists can use to boost their careers, backedup with real data and statistics.
